___

#### Engineer
I've been in software since 2010, mostly working with Java and government sector industries such as some national laboratories and Raytheon Technologies.  I currently work at Alexa with machine learning systems that use AI to collect and categorize news.

#### Pilot
I got my private pilot license in 2014 in a C-172.  Since then I've flown fixed wing and helicopters.  I love the science and engineering that goes into aircraft.

#### Gamer
I usually spend my free time with games, either making them or playing them.  Some of my favorite games are Factorio, Elden Ring, and Morrowind.
